Programming for the Musician
=============================

Program MIDI patterns seamlessly with multiple MIDI ports.

<Still a concept! Watch this space!>

There are many live coding music platforms out there, but most of them were intended for programmers.
Herein lies my attempt to create one for the Musician instead.

(Also I do know Sonic Pi exists, but it's technically not 'for the Musician' either, as it doesn't support MIDI
out of the box.)

Inspired by the robustness of Tidal's patterns, the simplicity of Sonic Pi, and the straightforwardness of
Wulfcode.


Here are some of my brainstorms, TODOs and other thoughts while I code this behemoth (at least it is to me...)

Platform:
Java FX for GUI
javax.sound.midi for MIDI
(Hopefully I can create my out simple code highlighter/indenter thingy so I don't have to learn more APIs :P)

Current Thoughts:
Syntax
Code Highlighting
How to get this swing thingy to actually work out
